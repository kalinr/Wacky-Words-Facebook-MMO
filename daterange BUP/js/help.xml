	<h2 align="center">Date Range Table Help</h2>
	This is the table of date ranges. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The client, campaign and banner fields are simply information for you to use to keep track of your banners and are not loaded into the Flash modules. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The start date and end date fields represent the actual data that will be loaded into the banner. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ID is the key for this date set and will be placed into the actionscript of the banner to load the start date and end date information. Give this ID value to your developer to enter into their code. Nothing else should be needed. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select button is for your convenience in case you wish to create a second date set or custom field for the same banner. All it does it enter the client, campaign and banner information into the form entry fields below so you don't need to retype them. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Delete button will delete this entry entirely from the database, which you should only do once the banner has been discontinued or if you are sure the date range is not being used. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Update button will load the table row information into the date range form field below and change the functionality of the form so that it updates this row of data instead of adding a new entry.]]></date_range_table>
